# nuxt3-app-vue-i18n

This project is created following the steps in [vue-i18n nuxt3 integration guide](https://vue-i18n.intlify.dev/guide/integrations/nuxt3.html#example-codes), and also optimized such that the lang dropdown shows options based on your available locales, so that you don't have to manually declare your own.

Locales are generated using [deepl-translate-github-action](https://github.com/lyqht/deepl-translate-github-action).
